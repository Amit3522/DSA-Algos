public class Solution {
    public int numSetBits(int A) {
        String ans = new String();
        while(A!=0){
            ans = A%2 + ans;
            A = A/2;
        }
        int count =0; 
        for(int i= 0;i<ans.length();i++){
            if(ans.charAt(i)=='1'){
                count = count+1;
            }
