Problem Description

You are given a N X N integer matrix. You have to find the sum of all the minor diagonal elements of A.

Minor diagonal of a M X M matrix A is a collection of elements A[i, j] such that i + j = M + 1 (where i, j are 1-based).

public class Solution {
    // DO NOT MODIFY THE ARGUMENTS WITH "final" PREFIX. IT IS READ ONLY
    public int solve(final int[][] A) {
        int r=A.length;
        int c= A[0].length;
        int sum=0;
        for(int i=0;i<r;i++){
            for(int j=0;j<c;j++){
                if(i+j+2==r+1){
                    sum=sum+A[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
